# LinkHighlightingMode
Enumerates the annotation’s highlighting mode, the visual effect to be used when the mouse button is pressed or held down inside its active area.

## Enum
 Name | Description
------------ | ------------
**None** | No highlighting.
**Invert** | Invert the contents of the annotation rectangle.
**Outline** | Invert the annotation’s border.
**Push** | Display the annotation’s down appearance, if any. If no down appearance is defined, offset the contents of the annotation rectangle to appear as if it were being pushed below the surface of the page.
**Toggle** | Same as Push (which is preferred).
